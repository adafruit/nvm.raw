This repo is the "raw" counterpart of the [`nvm.toml` repo](https://github.com/adafruit/nvm.toml). This repo contains source datasheets and raw data captured from the flash chips. It is separate to keep the size of the `nvm.toml` repo small because it is submoduled into other repos. Datasheets are included in case the original version is no longer available.

Shared data goes in a toml file with a name that matches the folder name.

The [template](nvm-data.template.toml) documents all of the possible fields.
